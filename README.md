# Loki

Last update: November 16, 2005

## Directions

To use Loki, simply extract the files from the archive,
give your compiler access to their include path:

- if you have a standard conforming compiler use "loki/include/loki"
  or "loki/include" for "#include <loki/HeaderFile.h>" usage

- if you have a non-conforming compiler use "loki/include/noncc/loki"
  or "loki/include/noncc" for "#include <loki/HeaderFile.h>" usage.
  The noncc files are declared as 'deprecated' and will be removed in
  future. They are also not updated with the new features of Loki
  and bugfixes (unless YOU do it).

If you use the small object allocator directly or indirectly
(through the Functor class) you must add src/SmallObj.cpp to your
project/makefile.

If you use Singletons with longevity you must add
src/Singleton.cpp to your project/makefile.

If you use OrderedStatic.h with you must add
src/OrderedSataic.cpp to your project/makefile.

Or use the library generated by make.msvc.bat, make.mingw.bat,
or make.
